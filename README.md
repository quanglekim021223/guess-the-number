Project Summary:

Title: Number Guessing Game

Description: This project is a simple yet engaging number guessing game implemented in Python. It consists of two main parts: a user-guessing game and a computer-guessing game.

In the user-guessing game, the program generates a random number, and the user has to guess it. The program provides hints whether the user's guess is too high or too low, enhancing the user interaction.

In the computer-guessing game, the user thinks of a number, and the computer makes guesses based on user feedback. The user provides feedback if the computer's guess is too high, too low, or correct, and the computer adjusts its guesses accordingly.

Technology Used: The project is entirely developed using Python, a powerful and easy-to-read programming language. It utilizes Python's built-in random library to generate random numbers.

Main Tasks: The project's main tasks include generating random numbers, receiving user input, processing the input to provide game functionality, and handling exceptions to ensure the robustness of the game.
